# character-voices
Hackathon project where we took a book and gave each character a voice and narrated it

1. cd into /app and /server and run npm install respectively
2. create a .env in the root directory and copy paste the API key in there
3. The app is just npm start and runs on port 3000 like normal
4. the server theroetical should work with npm run start but it currently hates me
